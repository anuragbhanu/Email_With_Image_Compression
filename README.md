# Secure Image Transfer with Server Relay

This project demonstrates secure image sending using AES and RSA with a server relay.

## Files

- `keyGen.py`: Generates RSA key pairs for Alice and Bob in `keys/`.
- `server.py`: Listens on two ports and relays data from sender to receiver.
- `Sender.py`: Compresses, encrypts, signs an image, and sends to server.
- `Receiver.py`: Connects to server, decrypts, verifies, and saves the image.
- `logo_nitp.jpg`: Sample image placeholder.
- `keys/`: Directory for RSA keys (generated by `keyGen.py`).

## Usage

1. Generate keys:
   ```bash
   python keyGen.py
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```
3. Start the receiver in another terminal:
   ```bash
   python Receiver.py
   ```
4. Send the image from sender terminal:
   ```bash
   python Sender.py
   ```

The receiver will save the decrypted image as `received_image.jpg`.
